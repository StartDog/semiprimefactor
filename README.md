some simple programs to factor semiprimes

I am interested in semiprimes - mostly due to RSA encryption but 
they have an interest outside of that as well.  I am interested
in simple number factoring programs.  I have a bunch I have been
working on but am uploading them slowly.  The only really original
one is the lupdownfinal.gp

the language is Pari gp which I found to be much faster than Python - especially with large numbers.
