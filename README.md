some simple programs to factor semiprimes

I am interested in semiprimes - mostly due to RSA encryption but 
they have an interest outside of that as well.  I am interested
in simple number factoring programs.  I have a bunch I have been
working on but am uploading them slowly.  The only really original
one is the ldnfinal.gp.  Pollard's Rho is fun as well.  Chosing 
the starting 3 factors for this particular implementation is a
interesting challenge. (Sorry for using the word interesting too
much.) With the right starting factors, any number could be factored
quickly.  But I have not really found good general starting factors.


the language is Pari gp which I found to be much faster than Python - especially with large numbers.
